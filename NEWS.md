# treeco 0.0.1.9000

* Added `pkgdown` support.
* Fixes bug where `eco_guess` only guessed unique values of `x`, this meant a 
user with duplicates would have issues assigning `x` to a `data.frame` as their lengths would differ.

# treeco 0.0.0.9000

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
